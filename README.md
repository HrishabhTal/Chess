You are required to create a program, which simulates an empty chessboard and the movements of three types of chess pieces on it.
Chessboard: The chessboard is an 8 x 8 grid with 64 cells in it. With 8 rows (1, 2, 3.... :sunglasses: and 8 columns (A, B, C.... H), each cell can be uniquely identified with its cell number.
Chess pieces:
The game of chess has 6 unique types of pieces - King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, Horse and Pawn - each with their own unique types of movements.
What you have to do:
You have to simulate the movement of the following three pieces on an empty chessboard:
Pawn - It can only move 1 step at a time, in the vertical forward direction.
King - It can only move 1 step at a time, in all 8 directions (vertical, horizontal and diagonal)
Queen - It can move across the board in all 8 directions.
These movements will be illustrated in the Input and Output section below.
Inputs and Outputs to your program:
● Input - The input string to your program will be the Type of chess piece and it’s position (cell number) on the
chessboard. E.g. Pawn, G1
● Output - Once you execute the program, the output will be a string of all possible cells in which the chess piece can
move from its current position. For the above input, the output would be G2.
Examples:
● Input - King, D5
● Output - C4, C5, C6, D4, D6, E4, E5, E6
